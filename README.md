# Charting New Heights:
Perspective on Aircraft Investment & Risk Mitigation

## Overview
This project analyzes airplane accident data in order to determine which aircraft(s) are the lowest risk to begin a new business endeavor: operating private and commercial airplanes. The undisclosed company will be able to use this data to decide which aircraft will be their first investment.

## Business Understanding
A company is looking to invest in airplanes, and would like to know which airplanes would be the lowest risk to branch out to offering commercial and private travel options.


## Data 
Understanding
Accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was used and analyzed. Each accident has an associated unique ID. The data file provides type of aircraft, severity of accident, damage to aircraft, and other characteristics involved with accidents.

Preparation
 
-----

Our team begins the data cleaning process by investigating the values in the dataset, reviewing the data frame, and then we identify and focus on relevant elements.
Then we remove the duplicates, normalize strings, and apply necessary filters to ensure consistency. The subsequent analyses are conducted on this refined dataset, enhancing data quality and facilitating meaningful insights.

## Analysis and Results/Recommendations

    Reveiwing the data 
This project used data analysis. This showed an overview of trends of airplane accidents over time and injured vs. uninjured in accidents per make.

## Conlusion and Next Steps

For smaller airplanes, invest in Cessna or Piper

For larger airplanes, invest in Boeing

Focus on extra safety measures during cruise, approach, & takeoff

ROI
Find ROI comparing smaller & larger airplanes for our companyâ€™s entrance into the market

Risk Mitigation
Develop extra training programs at high-risk flight phase points

Further Analysis
Cost of repair or replacement
Occurrence of accidents & why
Investigate airplanes equipped with extra safety features
